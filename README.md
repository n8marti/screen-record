# screen-record

### To Do
- This is too clunky:
  - You have to select the capture region from a screenshot of the desktop.
  - You need to be able to draw a rectangle over the desktop itself to ID the capture region.
  - Possible solution: Define a transparent image the same size as the desktop.
- The cursor needs to be captured, too.
